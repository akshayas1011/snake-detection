# Snake-detection
Automatic Snake detection using AI technique
**PROBLEM STATEMENT**
This project is based on python and machine learning, which helps to detect the snake whether it is a venomous or non-venomous snake.
In this detection, we mainly focused on snake bite detection system. Because, most of the deaths are caused by snakes especially in 
agricultural fields, park, and other public areas.
**SOLUTION**
To overcome this issues, we created an interface where user can easily interact and able to detect the snake.
We used CNN algorithm to train the dataset, that contains different angled snake images are imported and give as an input in the dataset.
The model used to extract the snake features like head position, skin texture, skin colour, eye strucuture.
So, this model used to extract within mininum layers and produces higher accuracy rate by using sequential model.
